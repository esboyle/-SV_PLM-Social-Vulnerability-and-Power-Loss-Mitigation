# SV_PLM: Social Vulnerability and Power Loss Mitigation
Component based event simulation for stochastic failures of power networks during extreme events.


## About

The SV_PLM (Social Vulnerability and Power Loss Mitigation) package is designed to allow users to model the social vulnerability impact associated with power transmission network losses in a given region. The included data files allow the package to be used for simulation of the transmission system of Puerto Rico. The Component Based Event Simulation (CBES) model given here has 5 key components, outlined below. In depth details of the methodology can be found in:

## Modeling Components

Weather Event Generation: Simulates the maximum windspeed exerted on each transmission line of network

Fragility Model: Determines the fragility of each transmission line of the network based on the observed maximum windspeed by geographical region. Based on fragility of transmission towers reported in:

Stochastic Network Breakage: Simulates failures of transmission lines

Power Flow Model: Simulates power flow through a given network

Social Vulnerability Model: Estimates impact of power loss on social vulnerable communities and produces critiality metrics for identifying critical network components
